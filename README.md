# EEdit

A tool for editing encrypted files using a password and the
system editor.

## Usage

Very simple to use, just call it with the name of the file you wish to
decrypt and edit.

```
eedit <FILE>
```

Type in the password, press enter, and when you close the text editor,
it will encrypt it again and write to the file.
